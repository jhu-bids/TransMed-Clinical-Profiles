## Workflow 2 Demo - New candidate genes for disease

Description [here](https://github.com/ncats/translator-workflows/tree/master/Workflow2/Modules)

### Module 1 - Genes similar/related to genes known to cause Condition X
* Steps to access a clinical profile (i.e., patient cohort) for EDS 
* Steps to use a clinical profile to find diagnosis codes for EDS that can be used to search OMIM for causal genes
* Module 1B: Phenotype Similarity - What genes show phenotypic similarity to EDS-associated genes?
  * Steps to use a clinical phrofile to find the frequency of phenotypes known to be associated with causal genes, among EDS patients
