## Workflow 4 Demo - Candidate drugs for disease-associated phenotypic sub-cohorts

Description [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T5yXcdPTGbjXU9tVQA2gbkaYOKHxzvR_6QtEaec1yIc/edit#gid=1702278417)

### Module 1 - Identify patient cohort
Steps to access a clinical profile (i.e., patient cohort) for EDS 

### Module 2 - Phenotype mapping to individuals
Steps to use a clinical profile to find phenotypes that are frequently seen. Note: we want diagnoses and hpo phenotypes. Diagnosis uses "count" & hpo uses "fractionOfPatients")

### Module 3: Cluster phenotypes or rank all (or top N) phenotypes in a subcohort.

### Module 4: Rank & score clusters (probably most efficent if done as part of the algorithmic implementation for Module 3)

### Module 5 (branch 1): Find genes associated with clusters

### Module 6 (branch 1): Find pathways associated with genes

### Module 5-7 (branch 2): Find chemicals/drugs that have differential effects between the subcohort phenotypes

### Module 7A: Identify US FDA-approved chemicals/drugs in Module 7

### Module 8: Validate chemicals/drugs using original patient cohort in Module 1
